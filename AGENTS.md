# Guidelines

- Keep `index.html` minimal. Build the layout dynamically using JavaScript modules under `js/` and data from JSON files in `data/`.
- Place styles in `css/` and avoid inline CSS or JS in HTML.
- Product catalogs, financing options and regions must be loaded from JSON files.
- Run any available tests before committing. If there are none, ensure `git status` shows a clean state.
